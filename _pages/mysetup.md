# Hardware

## Custom Desktop PC

My current Desktop PC was created in 2021 shortly after the release of the [Ryzen Zen 3](https://www.anandtech.com/show/16214/amd-zen-3-ryzen-deep-dive-review-5950x-5900x-5800x-and-5700x-tested) Generation. Replacing my old Intel i6700k which was showing signs of age on recent games.
The Idea behind this computer is to be a Gaming PC and a Workstation.

Components:

* AMD Ryzen 5800x
* Asus NVidia 2080S
* 32GB DDR4
* 1TB 
* 1TB SSD
* 1TB HD
* 512GB SSD
* ASUS MB B550 Gaming Pro Wifi
* Gigabyte M27Q Monitor
* Samsung 27" C27H Quantum Dot 

The Ryzen is a great processor, it runs very efficiently in both idle and high load with lot's of cores. This PC runs Windows 10.

# Software

## OS

* Windows 10 - Seems to be still the most stable Windows, as Windows 11 still has performance issues with Games.
* MacOS
* iOS
* iPad OS
* Linux (Virtual Machine, RPIs and WSL)

## Apps

* Browsers: mostly [Brave](https://www.brave.com/) but on Apple devices [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/) works better. I gave up [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) some time ago, i was mostly using in the last few years just for the cause.
